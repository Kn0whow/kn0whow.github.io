## Introduction to me

Welcome to my blog! I am a sysadmin/cybersecurity lead working in an internal IT department. I have been a sysadmin now for just over 6 years, and have worked in IT in general for just over 7 years in total since graduating university. My first IT job was at an MSP, starting in 1st line support, then moving up to 2nd line, before eventually becoming a sysadmin. I am also a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certified by ISC2.

## Focuses in work

My main focuses in work currently are infrastructure (Server maintenance, Networking), and cybersecurity.

## Purpose of the blog

I started this blog to have a place to document problems and their solutions, or encounters I have in the IT industry. It is mainly just a place for me to monitor my own progression, but the thought of even one person finding something on here which helps them would be great!

## Blog behind the scenes

This blog is built using Jekyll, and is hosted on Github pages. The theme is [Minimal Mistakes by Michael Rose](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
