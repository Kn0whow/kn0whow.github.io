2025 has flown by hasn't it? I feel like this year has gone faster than any other year I remember. Maybe that's part of getting older...anyway, I thought it would be good to do an end of year review, highlighting particular professional achievements I'm proud of, and areas I'd like to improve on next year.

## Work achievements

This year in work has been a big focus on cyber security. A couple of companies we work with in our industry were hit by cyber attacks, such as ransomware, which really hit home to us, and made us realise that an attack could happen to us at any time. It's not that we've been complacent, we just needed that spark to get us to move quicker! We've also been improving our LAN network to get better performance and insight into network traffic.

Key achievements:
- Upgraded 4 of our sites to new firewalls.
- Rolled out new XDR software to all devices.
- Achieved Cyber Essentials Plus certification for the third year in a row.
- Upgraded over 10 switches to improve network performance.
- Improved our O365 secure score by over 30 points.

## Focuses for next year

My main focuses next year will be continuing to secure our LAN network, implementing VLANs in some areas.

Also, continuing to improve our security posture. Conducting security audits and reviews more often. Fortunately we have good buy-in from our board to help us bring new tools onboard.

## Professional development

As far as my professional development goes, a goal of mine for next year is to gain Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) certification, to go alongside my CISSP cert.

## And finally....

And finally, Happy New Year! To anyone reading this. I hope 2026 brings you good fortune and health, and plenty of happiness.
